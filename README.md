# LangChain Project

This repository is created to explore and understand **LangChain**, a framework for building applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It consists of four key projects:

## Projects

### 1. Agents  
Agents use LLMs to take actions based on user input. This project demonstrates how to build **autonomous and reactive agents** that can use tools such as APIs, databases, and search engines to complete tasks.

**Features:**  
- Implementing LangChain agents  
- Integrating with external tools  

### 2. API Chain  
API Chains allow LLMs to interact with external APIs. This project showcases how to **chain API calls** dynamically based on user queries.

**Features:**  
- Calling APIs dynamically using LangChain  
- Parsing and structuring API responses  
- Handling multi-step API interactions  

### 3. Chatbot  
A conversational chatbot built using LangChain. It integrates memory and different retrieval mechanisms to **provide contextual and intelligent responses**.

**Features:**  
- Implementing chat memory  
- Supporting context-aware responses  
- Connecting to external knowledge sources  

### 4. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
This project explores **RAG**, a technique that improves LLM responses by retrieving relevant external information before generating a response.

**Features:**  
- Indexing and retrieving documents  
- Enhancing LLM responses with real-world knowledge  
- Using vector databases for efficient retrieval
